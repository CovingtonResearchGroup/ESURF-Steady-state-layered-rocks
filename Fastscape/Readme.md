These are the FastScape.in input files for the FastScape simulations run for Figure 10. Outputs from FastScape were read into Landlab v0.2. Landlab was used to calculate flow routing, calculate chi, and generate stream profiles. Landlab v0.2 did not have a function to calculate chi, so we added one. However, the current version of Landlab (v1.0.2) already contains a built-in function to calculate chi.
